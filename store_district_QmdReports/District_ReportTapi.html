<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-what-drives-area-under-irrigation">Understanding what drives area under irrigation</h2>
<p>Much is heard about rain fed agriculture in India. There are several factors that can affect area under irrigation - ranging from government supports, demographics, distance from urban clusters and several known and unknown variables. With the given data we can check if the following variables have any relation with area under irrigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of Marginalised group population in village</li>
<li>Distance from Major government offices</li>
<li>Distance from urban center</li>
<li>Total population of a village</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A simple Linear regression to see if the above explanation has any merit</strong></p>
